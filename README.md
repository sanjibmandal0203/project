# Cardiovascular disease detection using Multi-Model data and Important Feature Identification using XAI 

Cardiovascular disease requires urgent diagnostic solutions, with deep learning models like CNNs offering powerful automatic feature learning from multi-modal cardiac data including ECG and PCG signals, though their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP address this challenge by providing interpretable insights into model decision-making, enabling clinicians to understand which features most significantly influence predictions and thereby increasing trust in AI-assisted diagnostics.
