# Cardiovascular disease detection using Multi-Model data and Important Feature Identification using XAI 

Cardiovascular disease requires urgent diagnostic solutions, with deep learning models like CNNs offering powerful automatic feature learning from multi-modal cardiac data including ECG and PCG signals, though their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP address this challenge by providing interpretable insights into model decision-making, enabling clinicians to understand which features most significantly influence predictions and thereby increasing trust in AI-assisted diagnostics.

## 1. Data set <a name="Data_set"> </a>

* The RAW ECG sample: The initial procedure was acquiring raw ECG data. Each signal records the value of 1975 patients and each signal is 8 seconds at the sampling frequency of 2000 Hertz. This implies that the signal of any one patient has 16,000 data points (because 8 seconds is the same as 2000 samples/sec divided by 8, or 16,000 samples). Thus, the first ECG data matrix is 16000 x 1975

* The RAW PCG sample: The duration of each recording was 8 s and 1000 Hz sampling frequency used, that is, there were 8000 samples per channel per patient. Thus, per channel, the total data matrix was of dimensions 8000 x 1975 with time points as row and different patients as a column.

**2.2.2 Implement 5-layer Convolution Nural Network (CNN) for feature extraction on PCG feature (2048 feature):**

The PCG channels, resampled, were given to fully differentiated 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a depth of 5 layers. The time-domain and frequency-domain features were precisely obtained by these networks by automatically extracting them in the signals. Every CNN was set to take as input 2048 samples and give out a compressed feature vector with 32 features per patient.
